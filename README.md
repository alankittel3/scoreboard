# Baseball Scoreboard with Pushbutton Panel and Bluetooth Mobile Application
Final Project for ECE4180 at Georgia Institute of Technology, Spring 2019.
Team members:  Matthew Aspinwall, Tony Lindeman, Alan Kittel, Lucas Nativio

This project is an Arduino Mega controlled baseball scoreboard.  A large LED panel is used to display the scoreboard, a pushbutton panel for editing the score, changing the inning, and resets, and a Bluetooth module for replicating the pushbutton functionality on a Android phone.
